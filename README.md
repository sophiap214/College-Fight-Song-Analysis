# College-Fight-Song-Analysis
College fight songs are a unique intersection of music, athletics, and institutional identity. This repository contains the code for a data visualization project that examines how common lyrical tropes, such as references to victory, opponents, school colors, and collective identity, have evolved across decades, by athletic conference, and by authorship.
